During his time at university, he became active in student organizations focused on animal welfare. He served as the treasurer of the University of Melbourne Animal Protection Society (UMAPS) and was involved in establishing the university’s Alternative Protein Initiative ([The Vegan Revolution Taking Over Melbourne's Millennials - Medium](https://medium.com/@charliellis/the-vegan-revolution-taking-over-melbournes-millennials-72c4308ef4e3#:~:text=The%20Vegan%20Revolution%20Taking%20Over,and%20the%20newly%20established)), reflecting his early commitment to promoting plant-based diets and ethical food choices.

## Software Engineering Career

After university, Gardner-Challis began working in technology and software development roles. In 2015 he joined the University of Melbourne’s Centre for the Study of Higher Education as a project assistant, a role he held through early 2018 ([Nelson Gardner-Challis (The Food You Choose)  in Melbourne, Victoria - Job Lookup](https://www.joblookup.com.au/p/nelson-gardner-challis#:~:text=Outreach%20Coordinator)). He later combined his technical skills with his interest in sustainable food systems by working at a Melbourne-based startup called *The Food You Choose* from 2019 to 2020 ([Nelson Gardner-Challis (The Food You Choose)  in Melbourne, Victoria - Job Lookup](https://www.joblookup.com.au/p/nelson-gardner-challis#:~:text=Nelson%20Gardner,educated%20at%20University%20of%20Melbourne)). At that organization, which focused on providing environmentally friendly and healthy food options, he served as Director of Logistics and a software developer ([Nelson Gardner-Challis (The Food You Choose)  in Melbourne, Victoria - Job Lookup](https://www.joblookup.com.au/p/nelson-gardner-challis#:~:text=Nelson%20Gardner,educated%20at%20University%20of%20Melbourne)).

In 2020, Gardner-Challis moved into the life sciences tech industry. He joined Mass Dynamics, an Australian biotechnology software company, as a full-stack software engineer ([Meet the team](https://massdynamics.com/meet-the-team#:~:text=Software%20Engineer)). At Mass Dynamics, he helped build core applications and user interfaces for mass spectrometry data analysis, bringing a “strong bias to speedy implementation” and drawing on his background in neuroscience, agriculture, and alternative proteins in his work ([Meet the team](https://massdynamics.com/meet-the-team#:~:text=Software%20Engineer)). His contributions at Mass Dynamics include developing tools and systems to improve the user experience for scientists working with complex biological data.

## Animal Advocacy and Alternative Proteins

Throughout his career, Gardner-Challis has been an active advocate for animal welfare and the development of alternative protein sources. While at university, he was a key figure in campus animal rights and vegan outreach efforts, notably as treasurer of UMAPS and a supporter of the University of Melbourne Alternative Protein Project ([The Vegan Revolution Taking Over Melbourne's Millennials - Medium](https://medium.com/@charliellis/the-vegan-revolution-taking-over-melbournes-millennials-72c4308ef4e3#:~:text=The%20Vegan%20Revolution%20Taking%20Over,and%20the%20newly%20established)). From 2017 to 2018, he worked as an Outreach Coordinator for Animals Australia, a prominent animal protection organization ([Nelson Gardner-Challis (The Food You Choose)  in Melbourne, Victoria - Job Lookup](https://www.joblookup.com.au/p/nelson-gardner-challis#:~:text=The%20Food%20You%20Choose%20,Of%20Logistics%20%2F%20Software%20Developer)). In that role, he engaged in public education and campaigning to promote animal welfare and cruelty-free lifestyles.

Gardner-Challis has also contributed to the alternative protein and cellular agriculture movement. In 2019, he joined **The Food You Choose**, a social enterprise in Melbourne aimed at encouraging sustainable protein consumption and plant-based eating. As part of the core team, he oversaw logistics and assisted in software development for the enterprise’s platform ([Nelson Gardner-Challis (The Food You Choose)  in Melbourne, Victoria - Job Lookup](https://www.joblookup.com.au/p/nelson-gardner-challis#:~:text=Nelson%20Gardner,educated%20at%20University%20of%20Melbourne)). In addition, he volunteered with **Cellular Agriculture Australia**, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing lab-grown meat and other cellular agriculture technologies. He was part of Cellular Agriculture Australia’s team of volunteers in 2023 ([Year in Review 2023](https://assets-global.website-files.com/641400f02d9306cbd4fb3f94/65c169aa6b5fdf065ad66a81_0826%20CAA%20Year%20in%20Review%202023%20A4%20V04%20FA.pdf#:~:text=services%20and%20expertise%3A%20%E2%80%A2%20Our,State%20of%20the%20Sector%20report)) and helped develop an online tool called “Pathways into Cellular Agriculture” to guide students and professionals interested in the field ([Nelson Gardner-Challis | Full Stack Engineer](https://www.nelsongardnerchallis.com/#:~:text=)). This prototype career-pathway tool was later launched as a public resource by the organization, aiding others in navigating education and careers in alternative protein science.

## AI Safety Initiatives

Gardner-Challis has become increasingly involved in artificial intelligence safety and policy. In 2023, he made a formal submission to the Australian Senate’s Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing the importance of mitigating AI-related risks. In his letter to the committee, he argued that **AI safety** is “one of the most important areas the government should be legislating around,” calling for Australia to establish a national AI Safety Institute to keep pace with global efforts in the United States and United Kingdom ([](https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=a0a0b5f5-8eb8-4b4f-92fc-11cc17784e26&subId=756093#:~:text=led%20me%20to%20believe%20that,pace%20of%20AI%20advancements%2C%20we)) ([](https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=a0a0b5f5-8eb8-4b4f-92fc-11cc17784e26&subId=756093#:~:text=Dear%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Adopting,and%20safeguards%20in%20the%20US)). He highlighted concerns such as biosecurity threats, unregulated AI development, and the need for governance and oversight in AI research ([](https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=a0a0b5f5-8eb8-4b4f-92fc-11cc17784e26&subId=756093#:~:text=tech%20work%20related%20to%20biological,This%20and%20further)) ([](https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=a0a0b5f5-8eb8-4b4f-92fc-11cc17784e26&subId=756093#:~:text=led%20me%20to%20believe%20that,pace%20of%20AI%20advancements%2C%20we)).

Beyond policy advocacy, Gardner-Challis has contributed to community initiatives in AI safety. In late 2024, he joined the technical organizing committee for the **Technical Alignment Research Accelerator (TARA)**, an AI Safety training program led by AI Safety Australia & New Zealand (AIS ANZ) ([Help launch the Technical Alignment Research Accelerator (TARA)! | Manifund](https://manifund.org/projects/help-launch-the-technical-alignment-research-accelerator-tara#:~:text=I%20will%20have%20hands,and%20will%20provide%20strategic%20support)). In this role, he works with other AI researchers and engineers to run a 13-week course aimed at upskilling participants in safe machine learning practices and alignment research. The TARA program’s goal is to grow a community of practitioners focused on preventing harmful impacts from advanced AI systems ([Help launch the Technical Alignment Research Accelerator (TARA)! | Manifund](https://manifund.org/projects/help-launch-the-technical-alignment-research-accelerator-tara#:~:text=The%20main%20objective%20of%20TARA,robust%20global%20AI%20safety%20governance)) ([Help launch the Technical Alignment Research Accelerator (TARA)! | Manifund](https://manifund.org/projects/help-launch-the-technical-alignment-research-accelerator-tara#:~:text=I%20will%20have%20hands,and%20will%20provide%20strategic%20support)). Gardner-Challis’s involvement in TARA and AIS ANZ reflects his broader commitment to AI alignment, a topic he has identified among his key interests ([NelsonG-C (Nelson Gardner-Challis) · GitHub](https://github.com/NelsonG-C#:~:text=Follow)).
